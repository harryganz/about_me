        <p>
          I am new to the whole web development scene, and entered it through a
          bit of a back door. As an undergraduate at Cornell University I studied
          biology, and was mostly interested in population dynamics. As part of
          my curriculum I learned some programming to help with modeling
          and simulation. I was very interested in programming, but continued to
          focus on biology. It wasn't until I started using Ruby on Rails as part
          of my work for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association) that
          I started seriously considering switching to developing software full-time.
          While working at NOAA, I taught myself the Ruby on Rails framework, and,
          for good measure, Node.js, AngularJS, and Express frameworks as
          well.</p>
          <p> As of writing this, I have only made a few apps with each framework, mostly to teach
          myself the different technologies, but I think that I am ready to take the
          next step and make "real" web applications. I would like to be something like
          a junior developer on a team, learning and improving as I go. I think
          I would be a valuable asset to any team who need someone who can learn
          and adapt quickly, and without entrenched bad habits.
