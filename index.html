          <h3>Why I Program</h3>
          <p class="indent">
            I learned the statistical programming language, R, as part of a course
            on biostatistics. It was immensely useful, and I taught myself as
            much as I could about R. It is a very high-level langauge and
            cannot be used to do many useful things on a computer. To expand
            my knowledge of computer science I took a course on Java, and probably would
            have taken more CS courses, but they conflicted with courses I needed
            for my major. In the meantime, I taught myself Python, which seemed
            to be a useful langauge, but I wasn't doing much coding on a regular basis. </br>
            When I started working for NOAA, I needed to teach myself SQL
            and some web framework to send data over the internet. I decided
            on Ruby on Rails, and wrote an R package as a front-end to analyze
            the data client-side. For the past year I have been
            managing the Reef Visual Census data, and developing tools to disseminate and analyze it over the internet.
            With my contract expiring on a few weeks, I have had a difficult time finding a job in marine science, and am now considering entering
            web develpment full-time.
